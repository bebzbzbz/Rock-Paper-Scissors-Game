## Design

I used Figma for my original design process. I have also created the graphics for the hand gestures by taking photos of my own hands, drawing them on paper and finally tracing those drawings, with a lot of care, as vector images in Adobe Illustrator.

## Future Possibilities 

<ul>
    <li>Bigger feedback for win or loss</li>
    <li>setTimeout and countdown until result<li/>
    <li>Animation on notice screen</li>
